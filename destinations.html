</font>
<div>
<p>North Sikkim is as fascinating as East Sikkim when it comes to tourism. It is also suitable for a family holiday for the numerous sightseeing opportunities involved. You could visit Lachung, a scenic village by the side of River Lachung. Yumthang is famous for being a valley of rhododendron flowers & hot springs.<br><br>
North Sikkim also receives heavy snowfall during December. This is a good time to visit it to enjoy the snowfall. The temperature often falls below zero. The entire landscape is covered by snow. Everything is white!<br><br>
Just near to Yumthang lies Zero Point, the last destination for civilians before China’s border. It’s also home to one of the highest lakes in the world, Gurudongmar Lake, at almost 17,800 feet. Khangchendzonga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located in this district.<br><br>
It’s both a national park and a biosphere reserve. You get to see rare Himalayan wildlife species like Himalayan Tahr, Himalayan Blue Sheep, Himalayan Black Bear, Tibetan Wild Ass & red panda.</p>
