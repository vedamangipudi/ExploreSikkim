<p align="left">As suggested by Sikkim Tourism, the best time to visit Sikkim is either between March and May or October and mid-December. If you want to witness the blooming natural beauty in Gangtok best season to visit would be in spring, from March to May. <br><br>Autumn, on the other hand, brings the clear view of Himalayan Range. If you want to capture the picturesque view of Himalayan Range, then October to December is the best season to visit Sikkim. During this time you can be part of various festivals like the Maniram Bhanjyang Tourism Festival where you can enjoy local homestays among many other things. <br><br>You can also be a part of the Cherry Tea Festival as well as Red Panda Winter Festival. These festivals showcase a different side of Sikkim.</p> </font>
